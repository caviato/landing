    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="question">
      <button class="accordion">Is Caviato safe to buy from?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Absolutely! Our platform is as safe as any other e-commerce site, if not more. Every traveler is thoroughly
          vetted and identifiable, and we hold funds until you confirm delivery. Your safety and security are our top
          priorities.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <button class="accordion">How do I request an item as a buyer?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          It's easy! Just fill out the form above with as much detail as possible. We'll send your request to our
          travelers and notify you when someone wants to fulfill your order.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <button class="accordion">How do I pay as a buyer?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          We currently operate by direct bank transfer. Payment is only collected once you accept a traveler's offer.
          Funds are released to the traveler only after you confirm satisfaction with the item.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>


    <div class="question">
      <button class="accordion">Do I need to pay import GST as a buyer?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          The decision is up to you and the traveler to pre-agree on. However, we recommend allowing the traveler to
          open the item or deliver it without the box for high-value items. This renders the item used, exempting it
          from GST. Be sure to thoroughly check the item before confirming using this method. For further advice, feel
          free to contact us at contact@caviato.xyz.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <button class="accordion">How long will it take to receive my item?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Delivery times vary depending on the traveler you make a deal with.
          On average, it's around 2 weeks after accept of offer. However,
          we recommend not ordering items needed urgently in the next few days, as they may not be fulfilled promptly.
          This can create unnecessary stress for both you and the traveler. As our traveler network grows, we hope to
          offer shorter delivery times in the future.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>


    <div class="question">
      <button class="accordion">How do I collect my item as a buyer?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          You and the traveler can decide on the collection method.
          Alternatively, if the traveler chooses to leave the items with us,
          you're welcome to drop by anytime to pick them up from our location.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <button class="accordion">Is it safe to be a traveler with Caviato?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Absolutely! We prioritize the safety of our travelers just like we do for our buyers.
          You'll <b>only receive requests after we've received payment from the buyer</b>,
          ensuring fund for reimbursement.
          Plus, we thoroughly vet all requested items to ensure they're legal to bring back to the buyer's country.
          However, we recommend doing your
          own double-check for added peace of mind.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <button class="accordion">How do I receive my payment as a traveler?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          We'll transfer it directly to your bank account using your preferred method. Funds are released to the
          traveler only after the transaction is completed, meaning you'll need to pay for the item upfront.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <button class="accordion">How is the service fee calculated?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Caviato takes a 30% cut of your reward. For example, if you set a reward of $100, you'll receive $70, and
          we'll take $30. However, we won't take any cut if you find a cheaper deal for the same requested item while
          traveling or if you receive a GST rebate on goods as a tourist. Our fee is strictly 30% of the agreed-upon
          reward at the time the offer was made. Anything beyond that is your opportunity to earn even more money.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>


    <div class="question">
      <button class="accordion">How much can I make in one trip as a traveler?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          It depends on the value and rarity of the items you're delivering.
          Higher-value and rarer items typically come with higher rewards.
          Some travelers have earned up to $800 on a single trip by delivering high-value items like gaming laptops.
          You can also accept multiple offers on one trip to maximize your earnings.
          For shorter travel distances, like to Johor Bahru, you can expect to make a decent amount depending on how
          often you travel.
          In theory, you could finance your entire vacation by fulfilling multiple orders at once.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <button class="accordion">How do I delivered the items as traveler?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          After your travel, you can arrange the delivery method directly with the buyer.
          Alternatively, for high-value items or if you don't have time,
          you can request us to pick up the item, and we'll handle the rest.
          We also offer pick-up services for low-value items,
          but there may be additional collection fees depending on the type and value of the items.
          Our logistics team is expanding to provide more affordable services in the future.
